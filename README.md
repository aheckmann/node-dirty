# v0.2 branch

This is me hacking away at a new version of dirty. The main concept stays, but things will be simpler, faster, compatible with node 0.1.30+ and less buggy : ).

# Todo

* flush(cb) does not really behave properly
* dirty.close()
* dirty.forEach() or dirty.filter()
* More testing / tinkering
* Final Benchmarks
* Update docs
